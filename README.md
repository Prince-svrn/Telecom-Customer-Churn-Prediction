# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, XGBoost, Kaggle
Problem: Predicted customer churn in the telecom industry based on usage patterns and historical data.
Approach:
	•	Performed EDA to identify patterns in customer behavior contributing to churn.
	•	Engineered meaningful features like average call duration, monthly charges, and plan changes.
	•	Built and compared multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
	•	Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and cross-validation for better generalization.
	•	Evaluated models using ROC-AUC and Log Loss.
	•	Submitted final predictions to a Kaggle-hosted competition, tracking model performance on the leaderboard.

Outcome:
	•	Achieved competitive score with an ROC-AUC of XX.XX (replace with your score).
	•	Gained hands-on experience with real-world churn prediction, Kaggle platform usage, and leaderboard submissions.
